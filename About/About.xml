--- Original Description ---
Brings the iconic plague doctor's suit into Rimworld

The Suit: Gives a tiny bit of armour and adds better tending quality, tending speed, improves surgerory chance, improves surgerory speed, and makes the wearer gain immunity quicker. It requires 10 steel (for the tools), 10 herb medicine (pretty obvious), and 100 fabric/leather stuff.
The Mask: Gives less armour and adds more tending quality and immunity speed. Requires 60 fabric/leather stuff.
The Hood: Same as the mask, but gives some cold resistance.

Bandages: A cheaper, but worse herbal medicine. Can be made at the crafting spot or a taloring bench, costs 10 cloth.
Laced Bandagers: Costs 2 neutroamine in addition to the regular bandage, but is better than herbal medicine. Made at the same spots.

The mod also works with Medieval times because I added the tags from that mod to my mod.</description>
